    <p>In the eighth chapter, three cards are painting the roses on a rose tree red, because they had accidentally planted a white-rose tree that The Queen of Hearts hates. Red roses symbolised the English House of Lancaster, while white roses symbolised their rival House of York, thus the wars between them were the Wars of the Roses.

    <p>A little more than a century ago, a city sprung up almost overnight. As a result, one of Miami’s many nicknames is the Magic City. Much like her geographical description, Miami’s history is colorful, magnetic and exotic. Ever-evolving, Miami is surging as a major international port and a gateway for global industries establishing footholds in the U.S. despite the City’s relatively young age.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Early inhabitants depended on the Miami River for food and spoke of their “Mayaimi” with pride. These early Native American settlers were known as the “Tequestas.” Later, Juan Ponce de Leon was the first European to visit in 1513 and Spain is credited for the first recorded landing in 1566. Shortly after the Spanish rule established a mission on the river’s north bank, the Tequestas were targeted for conversion to Christianity. The attempt failed and a majority of the tribe, disease-stricken with small pox and other illnesses died.</p>
